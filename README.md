# Scraping and Pre-processing West Java Open Data Bullying Dataset

This is the code I created for my team during the Capstone Project for the GoTo Impact Foundation. My responsibilities included data scraping, pre-processing, and data integration to facilitate analysis using Looker Studio and reporting via PowerPoint.

1. Initially, I obtained the data from the [Endpoint](/od_15436_jml_korban_kekerasan__tingkat_pendidikan_jk_kabupatenk) on [West Java Open Data](https://data.jabarprov.go.id/).
2. Subsequently, I performed pre-processing using Python on Google Colaboratory.
3. Finally, I uploaded the cleaned dataset to BigQuery for integration with Looker Studio. The dashboard automatically updates when the database changes.
4. Additionally, I saved the data to Google Drive for documentation.
