## Project Description

The focus of our Capstone Project was on analyzing and visualizing data to gain insight related to violence victims based on education levels in West Java. My primary responsibilities included data scraping, pre-processing, and data integration to facilitate analysis using Looker Studio, with final reporting through PowerPoint.
